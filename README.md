# Eat Or Be Eaten

The rule is normal. Use '↑↓← →' in your keyboard to move the player fish. Don't crush into fishes bigger than you, or you will be eaten.

There is still something to be improved. If you play it, it is easy to find the potential bugs ::cry:.  It is nice for u to pull request to help me with them.

## How to play

+ open the directory you want put. Open this directory in terminal. Then run this in terminal:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Doriyz/eat-or-be-eaten.gi
  ```

+ Then run:

  ```shell
  cd eat-or-be-eaten
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

+ Now you can play the game in your web by visiting ` http://localhost:3000/`

  (maybe other port,  pay attention to the hint of your terminal)
